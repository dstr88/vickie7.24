      <p class="faq-question">How do I know I need a therapist in Maryville, TN?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer hidden">You don’t have to be having serious symptoms of mental illness to need a therapist.  You need a therapist if you want to be a better person or solve a problem or end a bad habit.  Maybe you are grieving and just can’t get past the loss or your nerves are shot and you don’t know what to do with yourself.  Maybe you’re not depressed but you sure do feel down a lot or maybe somebody you love is driving you crazy and you just don’t know what to do about it.   The list of reasons to see a therapist is endless </p>

      <p class="faq-question" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">What therapy is best for severe trauma in Maryville, TN ?</p>
      <p class="faq-answer hidden">There are  a lot of therapies for severe trauma and different people respond better to different treatments and to different therapists.  My preferred treatment is called Accelerated Resolution Therapy.  I like it for several reasons.  The first is that it works fast so you can start sleeping again fast.  The second reason I like it is that you don’t have to tell me every detail of the event, I just need the context.  The third reason that I like it is because while I do ask you to re-experience it one time for five minutes— you already are constantly and in five minutes you never have to experience it that way again.  There are others, these are just my top three and Yes, I offer Accelerated Resolution Therapy </p>

        <p class="faq-question" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">How much should you see your therapist in Maryville TN?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer hidden">The frequency of sessions is typically dependent upon your symptoms.  Most therapists recommend weekly therapy and I do most of the time as well.  There are occasions where twice a week is recommended and there are higher levels of care.
            Most of my clients who choose Accelerated Resolution Therapy will engage in weekly therapy for 5 to 10 weeks and then drop to every other week for a couple of months and then to once a month and then discharge.  However, each individual is different and we make the decision together in session.</p>

        <p class="faq-question" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">What is the difference between trauma and PTSD in Maryville, TN?</p>
        <p class="faq-answer hidden">Trauma is an adverse, painful, negative life event(s).  PTSD happens when the fear response of the brain doesn’t turn itself off so you keep reliving the event(s) over and over again.  Sometimes you know what set you off, sometimes you don’t.   PTSD is often associated with combat or first responders, but it doesn’t have to be.  It can be a childhood event that to an a dult would just be a thing, but in a child’s mind it was overwhelming and terrifying. Maybe something as simple as “my dad raised his voice at me one time when I was a young child learning to hold my fork”</p>

        <p class="faq-question" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">What is the difference between a therapist and a counselor in Maryville TN</p>
        <p class="faq-answer hidden">Therapists and Counselors do have similar roles and training, however, therapists are likely to explore more deeply rooted causes for a client's behavior rather than focus on simple behavior change.  Counselors listen to people talk about their issues and allow them to express their emotions, therapists can use a variety of techniques to help people heal from the cause of the problem. I prefer to use Accelerated Resolution Therapy because you come up with your own solutions and any bias I may have is circumvented</p>

        <p class="faq-question" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">How do I know if I should go to counseling in Maryville TN
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer hidden">It’s easy to say that we all need therapy or counseling.  We all have problems.  Sometimes we have serious symptoms like, constant depression or anxiety, can’t leave the house, can’t sleep, over or under eating, addiction or even thoughts of suicide or homicide.  Most people need support because they are just not content, can’t make a decision, miss a loved one who passed away and just can’t get past it, or they can’t say “no” so they are overwhelmed.  Therapy and counseling both work great for both of those. </p>

        <p class="faq-question" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">How much does counseling cost in Maryville TN </p>
        <p class="faq-answer hidden">Counseling costs have a wide range depending on several factors, including insurance.  
            Currently My per session rate is $175

      <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-question">Why is counseling so expensive in Maryville TN</p>
        <p class="faq-answer  hidden" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">When considering the cost of providing individual therapy as a solo practitioner there are a lot of factors to consider.  Time is the primary factor.  A session usually takes a little less than an hour.  The work of maintaining accurate business and medical records as well as study and preparation for the session is all very time consuming.  Therapy is also a high burn out business as therapists listen to and carry the pain of their clients.  We Love doing this and I believe we are gifted for it.  However, to be our best at it, we have to create a healthy balance between life and work.  My rates are set to allow me to balance both and allow me to make a living and plan for the future.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">Is it worth talking to a counselor in Maryville TN?
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer hidden" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">I chose the term counselor over therapist because people search for counselors and I believe often don’t know the difference.  Resolving the issues that lead to insecurity, anxiety, depression and other difficulties is like taking the weight of the world off of your shoulders.

        <p class="faq-question">What are the Barriers to Accelerated Resolution Therapy?

        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer hidden" style="color: white; word-wrap: break-word;">Yes, this sounds too good to be true. That is the name of Laney Rosenzweig’s book *Too Good to Be True*; she developed Accelerated Resolution Therapy. While no therapy can ever be one hundred percent effective, Accelerated Resolution Therapy gets close. There are barriers; some people just aren’t ready to heal. It’s okay; the therapy will be here when you are. There are times when healing means changing so much that you end up not fitting into the place where you were, and you may not be ready to do that; that makes sense. Sometimes a spouse will come to me, a counselor in Maryville, TN, with a desire to heal themselves and then realize they are leaving the other one behind. I want to encourage you to bring them along with you if they choose to come. There are times when healing is a financial decision; if you no longer meet the criteria for PTSD, Major Depression, Anxiety, or Bipolar Disorder, will you lose your disability and have to go back to work? There have been occasions where someone wounded needed to wait for litigation to end before engaging in the therapy because they needed those emotions to help a judge understand their position. There are myriad reasons one may not be ready to heal. Genuine physical impairment may also be a contributing factor; I am not gifted with healing broken body parts. The thing that I, as a therapist in Maryville, TN, am watching over and over again is people’s emotions—that deep part of their heart the cardiologist can’t touch—that part is being healed.
